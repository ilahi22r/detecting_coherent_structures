This repository provides a computational framework for detecting Coherent Structures in generic 2D time-dependent advection problems using Lagrangian Data. The tools implemented here integrate flow-map construction, material-curve advection, and topology-based diagnostics to identify coherent transport barriers in unsteady flows. The project is motivated by the limitations of traditional LCS methods when applied to sparse, noisy, or irregularly sampled trajectory data. Topological approaches offer a more robust alternative by characterizing the entanglement and relative motion of trajectories without requiring derivatives of the flow field or dense sampling.
