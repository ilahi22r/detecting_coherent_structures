Here, we calculate the trajectories of the Bickley Jet using the Bickley Jet Differential Equation

The stream function is given by:

$\psi(x, y, t) = \psi_0(y) + \psi_1(x, y, t)$

Where:

$\psi_0(y) = -UL\tanh(y/L)$

is the steady background flow, and

$\psi_1(x, y, t) = \frac{UL}{\cosh(y/L)} \Re(\sum_{n=1}^{3} f_n(t) \exp({\iota k_nx}))$

is the time-dependent perturbation

The equation for the velocity field is given by:

$ \vec{u} = (u, v) $

We calculated that:

 $u_0 = \frac{\partial \psi_0}{\partial y}$

 $v_0 = \frac{- \partial \psi_0}{\partial x}$

For the first velocity field:

 $u_0 = -U(1 - \tanh^{2}(y/L))$

 $v_0 = 0$


For the second velocity field:

 $u_1 = \frac{-2U \tanh(y/L)}{\cosh^{2}(y/L)}$

 $v_1 = \frac{UL}{\cosh^{2}(y/L)}$
