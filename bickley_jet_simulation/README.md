# Bickley Jet Simulation

This subrepository implements the canonical Bickley Jet system used in coherent
structure detection (Hadjighasem et al., Chaos 27, 053104, 2017). It includes:

- Eulerian velocity field generation
- Lagrangian particle trajectory integration
- Domain and grid utilities
- Example scripts for colorful streamline plots and trajectory visualization

The repository is modular and organized into:
- `src/` — core simulation tools
- `examples/` — visualization and usage scripts
- `figures/` — saved plots

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
